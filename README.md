### **TL;DR** :bulb:
> This project does not require developers to disclose their source code; 
> only the final binary files need to be uploaded, somewhat similar to the 
> `.app` files that are uploaded to the App Store. Our primary intention is
> to allow everyone to share their creativity without compromising their code privacy. 


The release of Apple Vision Pro heralds the dawn of the spatial computing era, prompting tech enthusiasts and developers to start thinking about how to create unique three-dimensional applications on new interactions, systems, and hardware.

Since the WWDC 2023 keynote, social media has been flooded with beautiful visuals and demo videos of visionOS apps. However, with the Apple Vision Pro not yet officially released, it's difficult to try out other developers' creations.

To address this, we've developed the Let’s xrOS app, allowing you to test visionOS apps from other creators in the community, and experience the allure of spatial computing devices ahead of others.

We hope this tool will lead to more frequent exchanges among developers and foster the growth of the entire community.

Let’s xrOS is a visionOS application exchange platform, which will allow you to distribute your developed visionOS apps to early adopters around the world.

> This is the repository to download the Let’s xrOS app. You can download and install it on the release page, and play with visionOS apps created by other developers.
>
> If you want to **publish or update** your app on Let’s xrOS, you need to do so in [this repository](https://github.com/XRealityZone/XRApps).
